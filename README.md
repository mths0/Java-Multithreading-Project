# Java Multithreading CPU Scheduler

---

## Objective

To implement a multithreaded Java program that simulates a CPU scheduler supporting three scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR, Quantum = 7ms)
- Priority Scheduling

---

## Assumptions

1. In our simulation, a job is considered to have suffered from starvation if its waiting time exceeds the average waiting time of all executed jobs.
2. We begin counting starvation time from the moment a job is added to the ready queue, not when it's initially loaded from the file.

---

## Threads

- **JobLoader Thread**: Reads `job.txt`, constructs PCBs, and loads them into a job queue.
- **Scheduler Thread**: Fills the ready queue, executes the selected scheduling algorithm, manages memory, and logs execution.

âœ… Multithreading improved responsiveness:  
Job loading doesn't block execution, and memory allocation decisions happen concurrently.  
This simulates how real-world OS components run independently.

---

## Classes Overview

- **Job**: Represents a process with fields like burst time, memory, priority, etc.
- **MemoryManager**: Manages allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Scheduler (abstract)**: Base class for all scheduling strategies.
  - **FCFSScheduler**: Executes jobs in the order they arrive.
  - **RoundRobin**: Executes jobs with a quantum of 7ms (preemptive).
  - **Priority**: Schedules jobs based on priority (1 = lowest, 8 = highest) with custom priority queue handling.

## System Calls Simulated

| Simulated Call        | Arguments | Output/Effect                                      |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `allocateMemory(size)` | int size  | Returns true if memory available; false otherwise |
| `deallocateMemory(size)` | int size | Frees memory used by a job                        |

## Output Representation Preference

We preferred Gantt chart format for visual clarity.  
It makes the execution order and timing easy to understand in console output.

---

## Sample Output

```
Gantt Chart:
|0 P3 |22 P6 |34 P1 |52 P4 |67 P7 |92 P5 |122 P9 |136 P10 |156 P2 |166 P8 |174

Results:
Average Waiting Time: 37.80 ms
Average Turnaround Time: 55.20 ms

(Starved Jobs appear only in Priority Scheduler)

Starved Jobs Detected:
P4 | Waited: 52ms
P2 | Waited: 156ms
P8 | Waited: 74ms
```

## Software and Hardware Tools Used

- **Language**: Java 17+
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
- **Version Control**: GitHub

---

## Program Strengths

- Extensible class design
- Clear Gantt chart output and detailed average metrics
- Memory management handled independently via threads
- Starvation detection in Priority Scheduling implemented dynamically, providing adaptive starvation handling

---

## Program Weaknesses

- No GUI (console-only)
- Priority starvation detection based on relative average, not true dynamic aging
- No simulation of I/O-bound jobs or context switching time

---

## How to Extend to a Full OS Simulation

To simulate a full OS, the program could be extended by:

- Adding I/O management
- Introducing context switch delay simulation
- Supporting process creation/termination during execution
- Including paging or virtual memory simulation
- Simulating multi-core CPUs with multiple scheduler threads
